# super-harsh-guide-to-cs

Hey all, Here is probably my final take on this. I have been like many of us here, trying, failing, switching resources, starting over, giving up and so on... But after so many tries, these are, in my opinions the best the internet has to offer if you are ready to take the learning serious and not just wanting to be a code monkey. All of this is free, yes free, no need to buy a course from a random dude on the internet. For the books, well I'm sure you know, anything can be found on the internet if you dig enough. Just focus one these, no need for more projects, these have more than enough and they are really really challenging. If you manage to finish, you'll be in top 10% of the self-taught people. The textbook part is optional, but you should do it anyway, it will for sure improve your problem solving skills. Don't cheat, trying to find solutions online or such, take your time, it's doable, albeit harder cause you are alone. Finally good luck, well no it's not about luck, more about discipline ...

Start here:

CS61A - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (introductory cs course at berkeley, hard af but you will learn a lot if you keep at it)
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp20/

CS61B - Data Structures (data structure course at bekeley. Programs interact with data, you will learn how with this course. The MOST MOST MOST important course on this guide)
https://sp21.datastructur.es/

CS61C - Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (Teaches the inner working of a computer so that you can write optimized programs)
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa19/

Textbooks:

Basic Mathematics - Serge Lang (teaches basic mathematics as the title says, but is proof based)
https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Mathematics-Serge-Lang/dp/0387967877

Discrete Mathematics with Applications - Susanna Epp (basically the math of computer science)
https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp/dp/1337694193/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=discrete+epp&qid=1627280503&s=books&sr=1-1

Edit 1: There is a lot of questions/suggestions about CS50 so let me adress that. It's not a bad course, and if you have one and only course to take to learn basic cs and programming, it's the best at that. But if you have time the 3 Berkeley introduction course is CS50 on steroids, and every course on the spe part is more in depth. What you want when learning is to build good foundations so that you can learn more adavanced stuff later on.
